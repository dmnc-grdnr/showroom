### Welcome to my showroom!

This repository contains simplified versions of my pet/work projects for demonstration purposes and as a quick reference guide for future coding projects.

#### Currently on display:
- [DFS] **Dockerized FHIR-server** with resources imported from a simple FHIR-repository
- [JDA] **Job description analysis** - a collection of visualizations of web scraping results
- [NID] **Network intrusion detection** - machine learning algorithms applied to the detection of malicous network activity
